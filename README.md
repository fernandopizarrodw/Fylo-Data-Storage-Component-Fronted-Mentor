# Frontend Mentor - Fylo data storage component solution

This is my solution to the **Fylo data storage component** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-data-storage-component-1dFOwr6Jx). This component includes some interesting CSS layout and styling details, such as gradients, pseudo-elements, and responsive design.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive layout (mobile first)
- Absolute positioning & pseudo-elements

## What I learned

In this project, I improved my understanding of positioning pseudo-elements to create custom shapes (like the speech bubble tail), gradient backgrounds, and how to position elements both inside and outside of containers using relative/absolute positioning.

## Continued development

I want to keep improving my precision when recreating UI components pixel-perfect, and get more confident using `transform`, `::after`, and `gap` vs `margin` in layout decisions.

## Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Pseudo-elements](https://css-tricks.com/pseudo-element-roundup/) – Helped a lot with creating the custom pointer shape.
- [MDN Web Docs - background gradients](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient) – For using linear gradients in the progress bar.
